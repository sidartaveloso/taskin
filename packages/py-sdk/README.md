# @taskin/py-sdk

This package will provide a Python SDK for the Taskin API.

## Motivation

To enable developers to easily build applications and scripts in Python that can interact with the Taskin ecosystem.

## Purpose

This SDK will provide a convenient and idiomatic Python interface for the Taskin API, abstracting away the complexities of direct API calls. It will use `uv` for dependency management.
