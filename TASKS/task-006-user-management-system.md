# Task 006 — User management system

Status: pending
Type: feat
Assignee: developer

## Description

Create a user management system to persist users in .taskin/users.json. Currently, users are only created temporarily when found in task files but never persisted. Need to implement: 1) Auto-create users.json during 'taskin init' with default user, 2) Add 'taskin user' commands (add, list, remove) to manage users, 3) Optionally auto-persist temporary users when detected in task files. This will improve user experience and avoid repeated temporary user creation.
